  "content": "React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.

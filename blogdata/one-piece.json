  "content": "<div>\n  <p> \n Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit—who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger&apos;s ultimate treasure known as the &apos;One Piece&apos;, and takeover his prior title. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,Jp  Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the Going MerryJp —later replaced by the Thousand SunnyJp —and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, different types of scientists, soldiers of the morally-ambiguous World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.\n </p> \n <p> \nThe One Piece is the name the world gave to all the treasure gained by the Pirate King Gol D. Roger. At least a portion of it once belonged to Joy Boy during the Void Century. The treasure is said to be of unimaginable value, and is currently located on the final island of the Grand Line: Laugh Tale.\n </p> \n <p> \nThe One Piece is the driving goal of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, as well as that of multiple other pirates, who all seek to claim the treasure in order to become the next Pirate King, following Roger&apos;s dying words at his execution.\n </p> \n <h2>\nThe Great Treasure\n</h2> \n <p> \nAt some point during the Void Century, a man named Joy Boy came across an island located at the end of the Grand Line. Here, he left behind a treasure of unimaginable value. Stories of this treasure on the final island piqued the interest of Gol D. Roger, and he took the World Government forbidding exploration of the island as evidence of it being real. \n </p> \n <p> \nOnly the members of the Roger Pirates crew that journeyed to the island learned what exactly the treasure consists of. Upon arriving on the island and seeing Joy Boy&apos;s treasure, the Roger Pirates simply began to laugh. Roger described it as a &apos;tale full of laughs&apos;, which gave him the idea to name the final island &apos;Laugh Tale&apos;. Sometime after the Roger Pirates&apos; discovery, the world at large would begin to refer to Roger&apos;s treasures as the &apos;One Piece&apos;. \n </p> \n <p> \nBefore Roger was executed, he announced to the world that this great treasure could be claimed by anyone who could reach it, thereby starting the Great Age of Pirates.\n </p> \n <p> \n The closest the Straw Hat Pirates have ever come to finding out the nature of the One Piece was during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, when Usopp tried to ask Silvers Rayleigh about it. However, Luffy stopped him on the grounds that learning about it from someone else would defeat the purpose of their adventures and that becoming the Pirate King would have little merit if he already knew anything about the One Piece.\n </p> \n <p> After decades of speculations and doubts, the treasure&apos;s existence was confirmed by Whitebeard with his last breath. He mentioned that &apos;a grand battle will engulf the entire world&apos; and &apos;the world will be shaken to its core&apos; when the One Piece is found.\n </p> \n <p> \n During the Wano Country Arc, Big Mom had an internal monologue expressing the idea that &apos;some of&apos; the One Piece might be located in Wano Country rather than Laugh Tale. This has yet to be elaborated on further.\n </p> \n <h2> \nEast Blue Saga (Romance Dawn Arc, Orange Town Arc, Syrup Village Arc, Baratie Arc, Arlong Park Arc) \n </h2> \n <p> \n The East Blue Saga is the first saga in the One Piece series and it introduces the main protagonist, Monkey D.
